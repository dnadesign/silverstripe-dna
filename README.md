Unless you work for DNA. You can safely ignore this repository. This will be a holder for some of our standard boilerplate.

## Setup

You will need to define `SS_RAYGUN_APP_KEY="******"` in your .env file (if you haven't already), and update
```

DNA\DNARaygun\RaygunHandler:
  app_name: 'YOUR PROJECT'
```

in your project folder.
